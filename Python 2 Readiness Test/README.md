# Python 2 Readiness Test

## Challenge 1

Conjugate some verbs!

Create a function that takes in the following list of verbs, and prints each verb next to it's correct past tense (i.e. add an -ed ending) and present participle (i.e. add an -ing ending): 

```['add', 'count', 'fix', 'join', 'open', 'perform', 'produce', 'refuse', 'snow', 'wander']```

For example, the verb "explain" is "explained" in the past tense, and "explaining" is it's present participle. 

Sample Output:
```
    add added adding
    count counted counting
    fix fixed fixing
    join joined joining
    open opened opening
    perform performed performing
    produce produced producing
    refuse refused refusing
    snow snowed snowing
    wander wandered wandering
 ```


## Challenge 2

Create a text file that lists the names of people from "people.txt" next to their birth year, sorted from oldest to youngest.

    Isaac,1995
    Amy,1976
    Luke,1980
    Damon,1987
    Stella,1997
  ```

Sample Output:
```
    Name,Birth Year
    Amy,1976
    Luke,1980
    Wendy,1985
    Damon,1987
    Kathy,1990
