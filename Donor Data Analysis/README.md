# Donor Data Analysis

The goal of this analysis was to calculate the RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) values from donor data for a local charitable organization. 

Once these values are calculated, the donors can be segmented based on their RFM score, and Donor Lifetime Value for each segment can be used to give some constraints on how much money the organization should spend while seeking out new donors.
