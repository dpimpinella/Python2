# Python2

## Coursework in Python 2

This repository contains my work for Python 2 at the Community College of Allegheny County during the Fall 2018 semester. It is not comprehensive, but contains the best (or best commented) examples of my work, to be used as a reference for future students.


The Google Python Style Guide was a big help in making this work presentable.
